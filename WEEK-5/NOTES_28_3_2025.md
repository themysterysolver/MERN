## NOTES
---
- There are diffferent way to get elements
    - className
    - id
    - tagName
> **NOTE** there are something that end with *elements*.
- No declaration `reference error`.
- No value after assigining then we get `undefined`.
- Don't do,
```
getEelementsByClassName(abi);//WRONG
getEelementsByClassName("abi");//Correct
```
- The 1st one search in it's ***RAM***.

### REACT

- creates a **VIRTUAL DOM** in ***mem***.
- In mem it changes whatever it need to chnage then do it in browser DOM.
- It is a *js framework* .
- It is created by Facebook.
- React was initially two class,functional component.
    - Hooks was then intorduced then it got evolved more like a dunctional based React
- fully *functional*

##### how to create react?
- `cra` method
    - `cra` create react app
    - we need **node** for `cra`.why?
        - we need it for `npm`
- `vite` method

---
> **boiler state code** reusing same block of code
- npmjs.com
---
### npm and npx?

- `x` is for execute
- `npm` for later use
- `npx` to use it instantly

- **npm**:
    - it is used to install,update,manage js packages
    - runs script in `package.json`
        - `npm init` to *create* it.
        - stores *metadata* and *dependancy*
        - also stores versions
    - handle dependecny
- **npx**:
    - tool with npm
    - runs packages without installing them globally
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```
- This downloads and executes create-react-app **temporarily**, then removes it.
```
npx create-react-app@latest client  
```
---

### DEV NOTES: 
- `client` is used for frontend
- code.
- cmd in path
`ctrl+backtick` to open terminal.
- `powershell` restricts the acess,so use in `cmd`
---
### cra(create-react-app)
```
npx create-react-app
```
`npm i axios`
- `i` install
- packages===modules
- downlaoded modules can be found in `node_module`
    - heavily loaded,since it has a lot of value/data/content.
    - thus we use `.gitignore`
> **RUN:** client>npm start
---
### axios
- It is a ***HTTP Client***.
- It simplifies **GET,POST,PUT,DELETE**.
---

### package-lock.json vs package.json
| Feature              | `package.json`                 | `package-lock.json`           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Manages project dependencies   | Locks exact versions for consistency |
| **Versioning**      | Uses flexible versions (`^4.18.2`) | Stores exact versions (`4.18.2`) |
| **Commit to Git?**  | Yes                            | Yes                          |
| **Human-readable?** | Yes                            | No (machine-generated)       |
| **Created by?**     | Manually by developers        | Automatically by npm         |
---

### npm audit
- check for vulnerability
```
npm audit fix
```
- Tries to fix it,doens't change `packag-lock.json` try to fix vulnerablity ***without breaking the code***
```
npm audit fix --force
```
- It may upgrade packages to major versions, which ***can break the code***.
---

#### WHERE DOEES IT START(REACT)?
- starts at `app.js!` nope then go to `index.js` in `public>index.html`
---
#### app.js
- inside return we can use `html`,**above** it we can use `js`
- **interpolation** `{}` treated as ***js***
---

#### TASK & TEST
- `Expense tracker` what is it?
- Do it in `HCJ`.
- `50mcq` test
