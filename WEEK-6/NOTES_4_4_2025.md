### NOTES
---
### React router dom
- `url` has path
- Each path goes to new webpage
- Routing going to different web pages
- `react router dom` is the package 

- `jsx` => js xml
- **component** is a reusable part of code
```
npm i react-router-dom
```
-  ***react-router-dom***  helps in this page transion.
- create a folder anmed `page/` then save `.jsx` file here.
> ES7 react
- `rafce`
- `src/pages` make jsx
- `index.js` la import

- `fragmanets` `<>`

```
import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';
```

```
import {Routes,Route} from "react-router-dom"
```

- **interpolation** `{}`
<br>
- `path` in lower letter
- `in` pages use *caps*

- for using button `useNavigate`
- move and nav and ()
- webpage inside webpage 
```
</Home>
```
- **Component:** is a reusable block of code

---
### HOOKS
- 

---
### USE STATE
- they help us track of the function.
- it is a hook
- It accpets *2* values and return `2` values that is 
    - ***current state***
    - The function that will accept this state
- refresh,copy,dom elemnts
    - {a} issue
- how to make chnages in react?
    - defaulot top to bottom scan
    - we have something called **state**
    - no refreshing
    - if changed the *top to bottom* refresh along with the chaned shape.
- `state` each compoent have one.
- 
---
### 3 Phases of component life cycle
- Mounting phase 
- Updating phase
- Unmounting phase
---
### USE EFFECT
- It is an ***anonymus function***
- it is a *side effect hoop*
```
useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)
```
- `[]` empty dependency! It runs onlly during the **mounting phase**
- `refreshing` is also ***mounting***
- if nothng,we can say ***update*** that is if any chnage happen to any state then this will happen.It has no dependecny.
- if dependancy is given a `state`,whenever it chnages that particular useeffect will happen!

> **DEV NOTES:** CROSS button to clear console
---
## VITE AND REACT
- `ES7` in vs give *rafce*,*useState*,useEffect* bioler template
- `index.html` is the ***entry***
- Then it redirects to `src/main.jsx`.
- the `main.jsx` runs the react app
  - mounts ***app component*** into ***div id="root"***
- `app.js` contains the **main routing and app structure** 
```
npm create vite@latest
```
---
### USENAVIGATE
- used to move between pages
- It is a *hook*
```
const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate('/path'); // replaces window.location.href but without page reload
```
- used inside a component
- navigate to new route on click
- redirect after form submission
- navigate after async operations
---
## Home.jsx
```
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import Login from './Login';
import {useNavigate} from 'react-router-dom';

const Home = () => {
  let [count,incCount]=useState(0);


  const nav=useNavigate();
  const move=()=>{
    nav('/')
  }
  const increase=()=>{
    incCount(count+1);
  }
  return (
    
    <div>
    <h1>at home</h1>
        <button onClick={move}>Change to login</button>
        <Login/>
        <button onClick={increase}>Inc</button>
        {count}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home

```

### index.js
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';


const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();

```
### App.js
```
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import {Routes,Route} from 'react-router-dom';
import Login from './pages/Login';
import Home from './pages/Home';

function App() {
  return <>
  <Routes>
     <Route path="/" element={<Login/>}/>
     <Route path="/home" element={<Home/>}/>
  </Routes>
  </>
}

export default App

```

## sync and async
- **synchronous** after only one job finished it moves next 
- **asynchronous** is multithreaded
- java is multithreaded
- `js` is *single threaded* but it can also be `asynchrnous`,this is because of ***event-loop***
